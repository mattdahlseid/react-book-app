## BookTrack App Project Overview
This project was created to fulfill a requirement for [Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). Students were provided [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) that contains a static example of the CSS and HTML markup for the project without any React code. They were required to use React to make the app functional. 

The BookTrack App allows users to search for books from an API and store the books on shelves marked “Currently Reading," “Want to Read,” and “Read.” 

A “Notes & Quotes” component has been added to allow users to keep notes on the books they've read, though this component isn't fully functional yet due to API limitations.

## Acknowledgments
Former Udacity student [Maeva Nguyen Anh Phuong](https://github.com/maevanapcontact) has a great [YouTube walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6L2jLHV9j8) for the project that covers key concepts.   
For the Notes & Quotes component, I reviewed this [pen](https://codepen.io/alligatorio/pen/aYzMKL?editors=0110) from Alligator.io to figure out how to create a modal in React. YouTube videos from ihatetomatoes called “[React setState Tutorial 2017 – Add items to a list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt6eU-VCKoo)” and “[How to remove items from the state – React Tutorial 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_-tUnv5qXk)” were also helpful in understanding how to create the notes component.
